This package provides functionality to manipulate digital signals and its
attributes.

It provides structures for various signal types and allows
conversions from one to another:

* Fixed-point signed
* Fixed-point unsigned
* Floating-point

Signal types have semantics of golang slices - they can be appended or
sliced with respect to channels layout.

On top of that, signal types are desinged to simplify control on
allocations. Package `signal/pool` provides a pool to utilize `sync.Pool`
for memory reuse.
